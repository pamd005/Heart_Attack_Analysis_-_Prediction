# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction 🫀

This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of heart attacks using machine learning techniques. It explores various medical and lifestyle features to identify patterns and risk factors, and builds predictive models that can help in early diagnosis.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: To analyze heart disease data and build a machine learning model that can predict the risk of a heart attack.
- **Data Source**: Publicly available heart disease dataset (possibly from UCI or Kaggle).
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Training and Evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
  - Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)

## 🧪 Libraries Used

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
````

## 📁 Files

* `Heart_Attack_Analysis_&_Prediction.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow.

## 🚀 How to Run

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### Option 1: Using Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the notebook directly):

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually install:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open `Heart_Attack_Analysis_&_Prediction.ipynb` in your browser.

4. **Run the notebook**:
   Execute each cell in order (use `Shift + Enter`) to perform the analysis and see results.

### Option 2: Using Google Colab

1. Upload the notebook file to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Run the cells one by one.
3. No setup is needed as Colab comes with the required libraries pre-installed.

## 📊 Output

The notebook provides:

* Correlation heatmaps and feature analysis
* Model accuracy and confusion matrix
* Risk prediction based on user inputs or test data
